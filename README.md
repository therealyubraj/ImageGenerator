# PolyImage
Image generation using genetic algorithm

Inspired from rogeralsing.com obviously. I knew I had to try it when I saw it. Link for roger's page: https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/

This algorithm attempts to re-create a target image using polygons.

First GOOD attempt after 22-hours not optimized:
